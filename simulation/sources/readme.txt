python simulation.py arg1

arg1 can be p[robe], f[requency]. If nothing, the simulation will be frequency


Need python to be installed and the Simulation_probe.dat (4 column, x y z and sqrt(x²+y²+z²)) and Simulation_test.dat(x column) be present on the same folder.

For connect to this simulation, this is the external ip or local ip of the computer with the port 9001 if open or else 9003. Otherwise the simulation close itself.
